## Requirements

- deno 1.36.4

## How it works

_git autocompletion_ downloads two scripts from github

- A git completion script: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash`
- And a zsh completion wrapper for git `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.zsh`

Once this two files are downloaded in your homedir, a new `.zshrc` will be created
(in case of non existance, if not some lines will get appended), and then
it will proceed to clear out the shellâ€™s autocompletion cache.

After that, you can just refresh your terminal and that's it!

## Command

```bash
Run `deno run --allow-env=HOME --allow-read=/Users --allow-write=/Users --allow-net=raw.githubusercontent.com main.ts`

then reload your shell and you are good to go!
```
