## Requirements

- deno 1.36.4

## How it works

_git autocompletion_ downloads two scripts from github

- A git completion script:
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash`
- And a zsh completion wrapper for git
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.zsh`

Once this two files are downloaded in your homedir, a new `.zshrc` will be
created (in case of non existance, if not some lines will get appended), and
then it will proceed to clear out the shellâ€™s autocompletion cache.

After that, you can just refresh your terminal and that's it!

## Command

Run

```bash
deno task start
```

then reload your shell and you are good to go!

## Permissions

When executing `deno task start`, following permissions will be granted

- `--allow-env=HOME`: Allows `home` environment variable
- `--allow-read=/Users`: Allows read access to `/Users` folder
- ` --allow-write=/Users`: Allows write access to `/Users` folder
- `--allow-net=raw.githubusercontent.com`: Allows network access to `raw.githubusercontent.com` in order to download scripts
